      details: "As a group, we wanted to make something relevant and meaningful, especially in the trying times of COVID-19. We came across a comic and loved the simplicity of how the sentiment and the thoughts of the illustrator were beautifully depicted. In our project, we have animated the same in 3-D and tried to give it life. We have incorporated our personal touch in the animation, which revolves around the feeling of uncertainty, and how a vacuous feeling is overcoming everyone these days, regarding our future, our present, and even our own selves, as life as we always knew it has changed drastically. We grapple with this idea and feelings which grip us periodically, how to deal with them. More than ever now is the time to try and stay strong, and face this pandemic head-on. Togetherness, even as we stay apart, is our beacon of hope as the entire humankind faces the peril of Corona: how even socially distant, we are all alike, and the innate human sense of survival and finding strength in kinship, can trump the looming despair and uncertainty. After all, being socially distanced does not equal social isolation or disengagement. This is the message we seek to pass on.",
